Installation of VS Code on Windows 11
Prerequisites:  A Windows 11 system with internet access.

Download the VS Code installer for Windows from the official website [Visual Studio Code].
Run the installer and accept the license agreement. Choose your preferred installation location (default is recommended) and adjust optional settings like creating a desktop shortcut.
Click "Install" and follow the on-screen instructions. VS Code will be installed on your system.
First-time Setup for Optimal Coding
Initial Configuration:

Explore the VS Code interface and customize the theme (Settings > Appearance) and font size (Settings > Editor) for better readability.
Install essential extensions for your development needs. The "Extensions" view (Ctrl+Shift+X) allows browsing and installing extensions. Consider extensions like "Debugger" for debugging and "ESLint" for code linting (web development).
User Interface Overview
Activity Bar (left): Provides access to common actions like opening files, searching, and running tasks.
Side Bar (left): Houses the Explorer view (file management), Git view (version control), and other tools depending on installed extensions.
Editor Group (center): The main workspace where you write and edit code. You can have multiple editors open in tabs.
Status Bar (bottom): Displays information about the current file, language mode, indentation, and other relevant details.
Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
The Command Palette is a powerful tool to access all VS Code functionalities through a searchable interface.

Examples: Search for "Open File" to open a file, "Run Build Task" to compile your code, or "Install Extension" to discover new extensions.
Extensions in VS Code
Extensions enhance VS Code's functionality.

Finding & Installing: Open the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X). Browse categories or search for specific extensions. Click "Install" to add them to VS Code.
Web Development Examples: "ESLint" for linting JavaScript code, "Live Server" for live previewing web pages, "Bracket Pair Colorizer" for improved code readability.
Integrated Terminal
Open Terminal: Go to Terminal > New Terminal (Ctrl+` backtick).
Advantages: Integrates seamlessly with VS Code, allowing code execution and debugging within the same environment. No need to switch between separate terminal windows.
File and Folder Management
Create Files/Folders: Right-click in the Explorer view and select "New File" or "New Folder".
Open Files: Double-click a file in the Explorer view or use the "Open File" command (Ctrl+O).
Navigation: Use the Explorer view to browse directories. The breadcrumb navigation bar helps you jump to different folder levels.
Settings and Preferences
Customization: Access settings through the gear icon in the Status Bar or File > Preferences > Settings.
Examples: Change theme (Settings > Appearance), adjust font size (Settings > Editor), modify keyboard shortcuts (Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts).
Debugging in VS Code
Set breakpoints (lines where execution pauses) in your code.
Start debugging (Run and Debug button or F5 key).
VS Code allows stepping through code line by line, inspecting variables, and setting watches on variables to monitor their values.
Using Source Control with Git
Install the Git extension (if not already installed).
Initialize a Git repository in your project folder (Terminal: git init).
Use Git commands (integrated into VS Code commands) to stage changes (git add), commit changes with messages (git commit -m "Your message"), and push changes to a remote repository like GitHub (git push origin main).
